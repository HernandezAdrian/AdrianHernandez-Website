        <p class="lead mb-4">My leadership experience mostly pertains to my previous job as a ‚ÄúPerspectives Editor‚Äù for my high school. In the job, I had to make sure that any writers assigned to my section of the newspaper had a topic and were meeting their end of the week deadlines, so their articles were ready to be sent to our head editors and advisor for approval for publish. I also had major and weekly input on our editorial, our main article for each week, by expressing ideas on how to handle certain topics and bring up topic ideas each week on what we should discuss and publish in our paper.<br><br>

        I also have in-person and hands on experience in food service and construction industry. For food the food service aspect, I worked ‚Äúcustomer-service associate‚Äù where I received the order from the customers, collected the order from the chefs, and then made sure that each order was received by the customer that made the order. Depending on the day, I was either only dealing with gathering orders or only with collecting the order from the chefs and ensuring the customers were receiving their orders. I have held this role in multiple places, for instance in school while working for my school‚Äôs marching band when we were hosting a tournament or working in my aunt‚Äôs and uncle‚Äôs past taco business from time to time. In terms of my construction experience, my father owns a small cement business where he lays cement for his customers. I have worked hands-on with my dad by helping ready land for the cement to be laid and I have helped set up equipment and other materials that were needed to lay the cement and finish the job. I have also worked behind the scenes by helping recording expenditures, payments, and other important records for my father‚Äôs business.<br><br>

        Additionally, some general traits that I have acquired over the years include integrity, resourcefulness, determination, and communicative. The traits of integrity and resourcefulness would be useful in a professional setting by letting me be more open to help and critic for other in the workplace, while at the same time being resourceful in time my potential colleagues ever needed my help. The determination trait would be useful since it would allow me to finish jobs, even challenging ones, well and before or on deadlines. The communicative trait would be helpful in a professional space since it would allow me to communicate with my colleagues whenever I needed help and to my mangers and superiors for a problems and grievances that I would ever need to rely to them.
